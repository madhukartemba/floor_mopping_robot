# floor_mopping_robot
This is a 3D printed floor mopping robot which moves around the room mopping the floor. It has a built in water reservoir where you are supposed to fill water and cleaning solution. The mop cloth is attached at the bottom of the robot and the liquid solution drips slowly onto it when the robot is cleaning the floor.

It has custom encoders on the wheels which track each wheel's speed. This data is used to adjust the speed of each wheel to make the robot go in a straight line regardless of the differences between the left and right motor friction or surface. In other words it has traction control.

It uses an Arduino Nano and also has a 3D printed charging dock where it can charge. Its runtime on full charge is 3 hours and it takes 15 minutes to mop a whole room.
